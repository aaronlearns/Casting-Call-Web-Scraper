# Actor Web Scraping
I look through a lot of casting calls as an actor, and I couldn't help but try to automate the process.  
I made a web scraper to email me casting calls that I could apply to.  
It requires a working ActorsAccess account, as well as two emails.  
The first email is a server "dummy" email, which requires you to allow unidentified apps.  
The second email is the client email.  
Execute "python3 main.py" with the entire directory open.
