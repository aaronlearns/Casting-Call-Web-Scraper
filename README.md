# Actor Web Scraping
Just me programming some webscrapers as an actor, this web scraper goes on Actors Access, parses web pages to find casting calls, and then read them and matches them to a user based on age, race and gender. Once the casting calls are matched, they are put into an email, which is then sent to the user.

email.txt is a dummy file, which contains the text of the email to be sent.
